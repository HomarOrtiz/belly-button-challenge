In this assignment, we were tasked with building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiverisity dataset (https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. 

The interactive dashboard included a bar chart, a bubble chart, and a panel with general information of the patient.
